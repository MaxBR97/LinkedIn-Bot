# Linkedin-Bot
This project was made by me to automate the process of sending connects on Linkedin, as well as keeping track of them.

A video of me talking about the project: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/max-brenner-97b5ba285_%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%96-%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%98%D7%94-activity-7102372537220657152-UtcP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
