# Linkedin-Bot
This project was made to automate the process of sending connects on Linkedin, as well as keeping track of them.

## The use cases it provides:

* Send a specified number of connections to accounts that comply with a certain search criteria.
* Optionally send a predefined note to connections.
* Set up multiple tasks that include multiple accounts and perform them sequentialy.
* Save the actions performed by the bot to a database that keeps track of the activity.
* Scrape existing connections data from the account's connection list and present it.

Written in JavaScript with libraries: React, Puppeteer, Express.
