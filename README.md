# Linkedin-Bot
This project was made by me to automate the process of sending connects on Linkedin, as well as keeping track of them.

The use cases it provides:

-Log in and Log out to given accounts.
-Send a given number of connections to people under a given search phrase.
-Sending notes to connections.
-Setting up multiple tasks to multiple accounts to perform them sequently.
-Saving the actions performed by the bot to a database that keeps track of the activity.
-Scraping data about the user's connections and fetching it.

Written in JavaScript with libraries: React, Puppeteer, Express.
